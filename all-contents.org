Welcome to the webpage of the "Optimization Workshop: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications", to be held in Bogotá, Colombia. The main objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and students from local and international communities, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field of mathematical optimization. Our aim is to promote research among young researchers and consolidate a network of optimization experts in the region.

The workshop will feature over 20 talks by experts in various areas of mathematical optimization, presented in a single-track format. This structure ensures participants can attend all presentations, facilitating comprehensive learning and in-depth discussions. Our program is designed to benefit participants at all career stages, from students to established researchers. It will include:

- Minicourses to introduce new students to continuous and integer optimization,
- Expert talks on cutting-edge optimization topics,
- Social events for building academic connections,
- A poster session for students to share their own research.

We encourage all attendees, regardless of their experience level, to actively engage in discussions and take full advantage of the collaborative environment. Join us in Bogotá for this enriching academic experience that promises to inspire and connect the next generation of optimization experts!

# Join us for the "Optimization Workshop: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications" in the heart of Colombia. This event will explore the latest trends in Operations Research, Mathematical Programming, and Machine Learning.

# *** Workshop venue

The workshop will take place at Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota, Colombia.
*** About Bogota

Bogotá, the bustling capital of Colombia, offers a dynamic and vibrant venue for events, gatherings, and tourism. Nestled high in the Andes Mountains at an altitude of 2,640 meters, the city is a blend of rich cultural heritage and modern urban life. Bogotá's historic center, La Candelaria, is a focal point for visitors, boasting colonial-era landmarks, museums, and cultural institutions. The city is also home to a thriving gastronomic scene, eclectic nightlife, and numerous parks and green spaces, making it an attractive destination for a wide range of activities. Among Bogotá's many attractions, the José Celestino Mutis Botanical Garden stands out as a serene oasis in the heart of the city. This expansive garden, named after the renowned Spanish botanist, is the largest in Colombia and showcases a diverse collection of native flora from various Colombian ecosystems. Visitors can wander through beautifully landscaped areas, greenhouses, and thematic gardens that highlight the country's rich biodiversity.

The TransMilenio bus rapid transit system is the backbone of the city's public transport network, offering an extensive and efficient service across major routes. In recent years, Bogotá has also embraced a well-developed bike-sharing system known as Tembici. This initiative encourages both residents and visitors to explore the city on two wheels, promoting an environmentally friendly and healthy mode of transport. The city boasts over 500 kilometers of dedicated bike lanes, making it one of the most bike-friendly cities in Latin America.


**** Transportation

*Ubers and Taxis.* If you are a local or are familiar with public transportation in Bogota, we highly encourage you to use Uber or taxis. Uber is safe and cheap (most rides within the city will be less than $5 USD). You can also use the Uber app to order taxis.

# *Cycling.* The city has designated cycling lanes i

*Public transportation.* TransMilenio is the main public transportation system in Bogota. It is integrated with Google Maps. In peak hours, the system tends to be overloaded.
# There is a small caveat: the legislation for ride-sharing apps is not well formed and Ubers are occasionally stopped by the police (there are no implications for riders). But as a consequence, drivers usually ask riders to sit in the front.
# Please come back soon for additional information about the city, hotels, and transportation.

**** Hotels

***** Downtown (Close to campus)
This neighborhood is close to the campus and safe, but it lacks the amenities and appeal of Chapinero or the North.
